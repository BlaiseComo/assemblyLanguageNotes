- You can run a computer as fast as you can get the transistors to recognize the increase or decrease in voltage
- Hexadecimal bytes have two digits because one hex digit represents 4 bits
- 2^4 = 16, 4-bits, Decimal Range, 0-15, 4-bits = w
- 2^8 = 256, 8-bits, Decimal Range, 0-255, 8-bits = w
- 2^w - 1 = Umax
- A&B = 1 when both A=1 and B=1
- A|B = 1 when either A=1 or B=1
- ~A = 1 when A=0
- A^B when either A=1 or B=1, but not both
- Left Shift: x << y
    - Shift bit vector x left y positions
        - Throw away extra bits on Left
    - Fill with 0's on right
- Right Shift: x >> y
    - Shift bit vector x right y positions
        - Throw away extra bits on Right
    - Logical Shift     
        - Fill with 0's on left
    - Arithmetic Shift  
        - Replicate most significant bit on left
- << 1 results in a multiplication by 2
- >> 1 results in a division by 2
