- 5 Great Realities:
    - 1. Ints are not Integers, Floats are not Reals 
        - Ex. Is x^2 >= 0 , Floats: Yes, Ints: Not Always
        - Ex. Is (x+y)+z == x+(y+z) , Ints: Yes, Floats: Not Always
    - 2. Got to know assembly
        - Understanding assembly is key to machine level execution
            - Behavior of programs in presence of bugs
            - Tuning program performance
            - Implementing system software
            - Creating / fighting malware
    - 3. Memory Matters
        - Random access memory is an unphysical abstraction
        - Adapting program to characteristics of memory system can lead to major speed improvements
- Computer Arithmetic:
    - Does not generate random values
    - Cannot assume all "usual" mathematical properties
